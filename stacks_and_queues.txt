Exercises
1. The main difference between a stack and a queue is that stack has a LIFO priority whereas a queue has a FIFO priority.
2. Some of the similarities between a stack and a queue are that they both process one data at a time in a linear fashion and
3. I'd use LIFO for UNDO and REDO function since the last change that was made has to be retrieved.

Programming Questions
1. Reverse a string using a stack
function reverseString(word) {
  let stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    stack.push(word[i]);
  }
  let reversedWord = '';
  for (let i = stack.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversedWord+= stack[i];
  }
  return reversedWord;
}

2. Implement the pop method using FIFO
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
  }
  enqueue(element) {
    this.queue.push(element);
  }
  dequeue(this.queue) {
    let temp = this.queue[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < this.queue.length; i++) {
      this.queue[i - 1] = this.queue[i];
    }
    this.queue.pop();
    return temp;
  }
  pop(element) {
    this.enqueue(element);
    this.dequeue();
  }
}
