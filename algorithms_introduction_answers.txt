1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee:
FILL carafe WITH water
PLACE carafe ON heatingPlate
MEASURE coffeeGrounds
PLACE coffeeGrounds IN filter
PLACE filter IN filterBasket
CLOSE lid
START coffeeMaker

Washing dishes:
SCRAPE dishes
  IF food === stuck THEN
    SOAK IN hotWater
FILL dishPan WITH hotWater
ADD dishSoap
WHILE dish === dirty
    SCRUB dishes
ENDWHILE
IF water === greasy
  CHANGE water
RINSE WITH hotWater
PLACE ON dryingRack
AIR DRY || WIPE WITH towel

Flossing teeth:
CUT floss
WRAP floss ON finger
PLACE floss BETWEEN teeth
CURVE floss AROUND teeth
SLIDE floss BETWEEN gumLine
WHILE debris
  MOVE floss up && down
ENDWHILE

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Tesla: As a pioneer in the electric vehicle market among other products, Tesla is building new AI that is believed to process the "thinking" algorithms for their autopilot software for autonomous driving capability. Tesla has been collecting data with a lot more sensors on the roads than its competitors. All Tesla models send data directly to the cloud and problems such as overheating is diagnosed by monitoring data and fixed automatically by software. I think it's awesome that Tesla is trying to automate driving and taking our experiences to a whole another level.

Uber: I remember the days when I had to call the yellow cab by calling a number to have a dispatcher schedule a ride for me. Only several years later, Uber came about and with the tap of a button, an Uber driver is assigned and I know exactly who to expect and when. Uber has a dispatch algorithm that they use such as the modeling on the driver side based on various states like stationary, random drive, demand gravity, etc. Uber has disrupted the market and I absolutely love it as a consumer. It has made my life so much easier and I have never experienced any inconveniences due to errors in the app.

Amazon: Amazon recommendation system uses a mixture of AI based algorithms and I believe their system is the best in the market. I have used the system to purchase a lot of stuff and it's always relevant and they're some awesome recommendations. They use "item to item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time."

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
Efficient algorithms would not depend on one factor alone but have trade offs between several factors. Perhaps the most important would be how fast it is as well as how much memory space it takes up. Also, it's important for it to do what it's supposed to do and execute appropriately. An efficient algorithm would also avoid  unnecessary calculations. An inefficient algorithm might take longer, take up more space, and perform unnecessary calculations.
