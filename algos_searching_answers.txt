Short Answer
Q1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A: A real-life scenario using a linear search would be going through all the milk cartons at a grocery store to look for expired ones.

Q2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A: An example of binary search is looking for an item in a laundry basket; if it's a dark color, the items can be halved into dark vs white. If the item is small, all the big items can be separated out, etc.

Q3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: It would take 7 iterations to reach G via linear search.

Q4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: It would take 2-3 iterations using binary search (depending on where it's halved).

Q5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose linear search since binary search would require sorting that will add time.

Q6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose binary search as it will give O(log n) vs O(n).

Programming Assignment
Q1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
var arr = ["Albatross", "Owl", "Parrot", "Sparrow", "Woodpecker"];
function searchWord(arr, word){
  var low = arr[0];
  var high = arr[arr.length -1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);

    if(arr[mid] > word) {
      high = arr[mid -1];
    }
    else if (arr[mid] < word) {
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    }
    else {
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "Not found;
}

console.log(searchWord(arr, "Albatross"));

Q2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var arr = ["catfish", "albacore", "goldfish", "eel"];
function netFish(fishList, goldFish) {
  for (var i = 0; i < fishList.length; i++) {
    if (fishList[i] === goldFish) {
      return "Found the fish you're looking for!";
    }
  }
  return "No white-spotted goldfish are found in this tank";
}

console.log(netFish(arr, "goldfish"));
