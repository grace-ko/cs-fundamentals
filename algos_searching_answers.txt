Short Answer
Q1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A: A real-life scenario using a linear search would be going through all the milk cartons at a grocery store to look for expired ones.

Q2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A: An example of binary search is looking for an item in a laundry basket; if it's a dark color, the items can be halved into dark vs white. If the item is small, all the big items can be separated out, etc.

Q3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: It would take 7 iterations to reach G via linear search.

Q4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: It would take 2-3 iterations using binary search (depending on where it's halved).

Q5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose linear search since binary search would require sorting that will add time.

Q6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would choose binary search as it will give O(log n) vs O(n).
